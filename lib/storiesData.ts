    title: "“I met Jake when I was 24...”",
    text: "I met Jake when I was 24, just out of a bad breakup and desperate for someone who felt steady. He was charming, attentive, and always said the right things. Within weeks, I was completely hooked. I thought I’d found ‘the one.’ But over time, I noticed he never really listened to me — only talked about himself. He'd twist my words, gaslight me constantly, and somehow, I was always apologizing. I didn’t realize I was being emotionally manipulated until I couldn’t even recognize myself anymore."

    title: "“Samantha came into my life like a hurricane...”",
    text: "Samantha came into my life like a hurricane — beautiful, intense, passionate. She made me feel like I was the center of her universe… for about two weeks. Then came the silent treatments, the backhanded compliments, the sudden mood swings. One day, she loved me; the next, I was worthless. I kept trying to earn back the person I met in the beginning, not realizing that version of her never really existed."

    title: "“When I first met Leo, I thought he was just confident...”",
    text: "When I first met Leo, I thought he was just confident — maybe a little arrogant, but in a funny, charismatic way. But that confidence quickly turned into control. He isolated me from my friends, belittled me in front of others with a smile, and made me question every decision I made. I spent years thinking I wasn’t good enough, until one day, I finally broke through the fog and left for good."
